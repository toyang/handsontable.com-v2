            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="//nuxeo.com/" target="_blank">Nuxeo</a> is a software vendor providing a hyperscale
                digital asset platform. Their platform helps customers to make a fundamental shift to a new digital
                asset strategy that turns data into highly usable digital assets. Organizations can expand their content
                strategy beyond todayâ€™s limited and departmental use of digital assets to create new revenue streams,
                increase productivity, and drive their competitive advantage
            </p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                Their goal was to find a solution that would allow bulk-editing document metadata and at the same
                time could provide a great user experience. Although it was the first time they offered
                this kind of tool to their users, the spreadsheet pattern seemed to be a good choice.
                Before the big search for the perfect grid, Alain Escaffre and the Nuxeo Team had thought of
                certain custom developments.

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>
                One of the particularities of the Nuxeo Platform is that the content model is highly customizable,
                hence metadata edition can be made with very different widget editors such as drop downs, multiple
                drop downs, suggestors, calendars and others. Handsontable was so easy to implement they could
                incorporate the server's pre-configured data model in the grid without any problems

                    Handsontable had the greatest documentation, an impressive feature set and very nice state of
                    art packaging.

            <h3>Results and Plans for Future</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to that, users can install the Nuxeo Platform Spreadsheet add-on easily and bulk-edit content
                just by dragging values, which is very natural for them.
                What is more, by controlling the cell editor it is possible to enforce all the business logic that is
                needed, which means having the comfort of the Excel-like experience with some strong business
                constraints.
                The next step will be integrating Handsontable with the brand new Nuxeo UI based on a Web Component
                framework: Polymer.
