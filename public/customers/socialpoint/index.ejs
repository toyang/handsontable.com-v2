            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                As Julio de la Calle from Social Point says, games require much configuration to work. This
                configuration allows the team to adjust each parameter of the game. With these values it is
                possible to optimize the user experience and maximize engagement. To manage all this information,
                they needed a quick and flexible tool, something they had found in Google Sheets, as it enabled
                them to manage large amounts of data in a simple and very visual way. Unfortunately, they began to
                suffer from certain limitations that prevented the implementation of more complex workflows to the tool.
                At this point the team decided to develop its own tool, based on spreadsheets, in order to add features
                they needed.

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>
                One of the big problems they had was the synchronization of data in the cloud with the the local data
                they had. It generated errors, latency and insecurity when synchronized.
                Therefore they had to integrate other services which were not allowed in the component they used
                at the time.
                The Social Point team found a solution, but still had latency issues and its development was quite
                cumbersome, so it had to be dismissed quickly.
                Luckily, they came across Handsontable, which was a perfect fit for their tool, as it allowed them to
                have a very similar interface to Google Sheets with relatively little effort, so they could focus on
                all the features that bring value to their team and ignore those that were superfluous.
                Since then, Handsontable has been a key element of their project
            </p>

            <h3>Results and Plans for Future</h3>
            <p>
                Social Point stayed with a similar interface from the outset and this helped users to feel comfortable
                at any time, reducing the initial friction when implementing a new tool. From that moment, they kept
                adding new features such as: versioning of data, data validations, different types of formats. The
                adoption cycles were small because the base was always something similar to what they already knew.
                For Social Point, the "conditional formatting" has been one of the features that has made a difference.
                It has helped to specify the data types for columns and add automatic validations.
                The support of AngularJS has been another important feature. Since it became the framework that they
                use in their stack, they have saved many hours of our work on integration.
                Finally, another feature that seems very attractive to them and which they intend to adopt soon is
                support for formulas to perform complex calculations in some of their configurations.

                As Julio admits, the Social Point team wants to develop further and improve their application in
                order to satisfy the requests from their users, thus improving the productivity of their games.

                    We recommend Handsontable without question and even more, if the project requires handling large
                    amounts of data, in addition to having a great team of developers creating new features and solving
                    errors for the community.
