            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.amcharts.com" target="_blank">amCharts</a> is a set of data visualisation 
                programming libraries and tools, created with developers in mind. For now the focus of amCharts is on 
                rich, interactive charts, stock charts and maps that can easily be embedded in websites. Founded by 
                Antanas Marcelionis more than 10-years ago, amCharts started out as a digital pin-map, and has grown to 
                include pie, line, column and bar charts - among others - managed by a distributed team of 13 people, 
                including two cartography specialists. Antanas Marcelionis is still the lead programmer, while Martynas 
                Majeris, as CTO, manages both development and product design. They pride themselves on their "by choice"
                compactness, agility and ability to offer a superior technical support experience, with no plans to 
                change any of this, while continuing to offer a great product for anyone needing to create rich, 
                interactive charts and maps.
            </p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                Although amCharts was first created with developers in mind, Antanas soon realised there was a need to 
                make the tool accessible to non-developers. Not all users were comfortable using CSV and JSON - 
                the standard formats for data sources in amCharts - so the team had to find a solution that would make 
                amCharts more intuitive for all users. The tool most frequently used to manage data, across a broad 
                segment of users, is Excel, so it would make sense for users to be able to add and manage data by way 
                of an interface that felt familiar.
            </p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>
                To make amCharts more intuitive and user-friendly for users unfamiliar with CSV and JSON, the 
                amCharts team introduced the Live Editor. The Live Editor makes it possible for users to enter and 
                manage data for their charts and maps using an interface not unlike that of Excel, with very little 
                technical skills required of users other than knowledge of commonly used spreadsheet tools. The 
                amCharts team realised it would make more sense to incorporate an existing solution to accomplish what 
                they wanted from the Live Editor, rather than altering their existing development path to build their 
                own solution, and Handsontable was this solution. With Handsontable, the amCharts team were able to add 
                an Excel-like interface to their Live Editor much faster than if they had developed it themselves.

                    Being a small, agile company, we especially appreciated the ease of communication, flexibility, 
                    and willingness to go extra mile from the Handsontable team.

            <h3>Results and Plans for Future</h3>
            <p>
                Since its introduction, Live Editor has become the primary starting point for all users wanting to 
                create a chart or map quickly, even for users familiar with CSV and JSON. Not only does the Live 
                Editor reduce the amount of time needed to create a new chart, it also helps to avoid the pitfalls of 
                mistakes in your code. Martynas states that it is the flexibility of Handsontable that has led the 
                amCharts team to look at incorporating it in future consumer-oriented products, even as development of 
                amCharts continues at a breakneck pace. In 2016 alone they enhanced the accessibility features of 
                amCharts, introduced an official React component and launched a multilingual plugin for WordPress, 
                along with a slew of other enhancements and features.
