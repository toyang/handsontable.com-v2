          <h4>How do you define a developer?</h4>
          <p>A developer is every person in your organization working directly with Handsontable source code.
            That includes implementing, integrating or changing the code.</p>
          <h4>How many licenses do I need?</h4>
          <p>You need one license for every developer working directly with Handsontable. Licenses are not assigned to a particular
            person but to each seat. If the overall number of developers changes overtime, you have to
            acquire new licenses for them.</p>
          <h4>Can I still use Handsontable after 12 months from the purchase?</h4>
          <p>Yes, you can. Once you buy a license you can use it without time boundaries. Although after 12
            months from the purchase date you lose the possibility to get updates and support. In order to
            keep them you should obtain new Maintenance and Support plan.
          </p>
          <h4>What is the difference between Developer and OEM license?</h4>
          <p>Developer License is intended for a single developer and allows to use Handsontable for creating
            websites, web apps, intranets and SaaS projects. It does not include the installation of the
            software on customers' premises nor selling in an OEM model. Contact our
            <a href="mailto:sales@handsontable.com">Sales Team</a> in order to get a quote on OEM version.</p>
          <h4>How does on-premises software work?</h4>
          <p>You can either install the software remotely or by doing it on site.
            You can do it through your employee or directly by your customer. </p>
          <h4>May I use Handsontable while working on many domains / servers / projects?</h4>
          <p>Yes, Developer License allows you to use the code on unlimited amount of domains, servers or projects.
            What is more, it does not depend on whether it is a test or production environment.</p>
          <h4>Am I allowed to add more developers to my license?</h4>
          <p>Yes, there is such a possibility. Contact us to do so.</p>
          <h4>Let's say we need more than 10 licenses. Is there a discount for us?</h4>
          <p>By default, whenever you get 5-9 licenses we offer you a 10% discount. For 10 there is a 15% discount.
            In case you want more than that please contact our
            <a href="mailto:sales@handsontable">Sales Team.</a></p>
          <h4 id="single-website">What is the difference between Developer License and Single Website License?</h4>
          <p>Single Website License, alike Developer License, is for a single developer but has some extra limitations,
            such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is strictly assigned to one domain only,</li>
            <li>It does not work for websites using SaaS business model,</li>
            <li>You cannot use it to create intranet, where you allow the authorization and let clients, users,
              colleagues to login. The only person allowed to login to a system with Handsontable installed is
              the developer assigned to that license.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Can I edit the source code?</h4>
          <p>Yes, Handsontable license allows to use source code and edit it, so you can easily integrate it with
            your product. We, however, don't support your custom changes to the code within the Maintenance
            and Support plans.</p>
